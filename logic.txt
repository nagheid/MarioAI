Logic here:
-----------
Will have a 2D array of block ratings in the grid. These ratings change dynamically as new obstacles come up. D* will find the best path based on these ratings.
Assume constant speed.
Position for enemies changes
Use D* to update their data strs with actions
In some place in the code, need to mark stuff as open or not. Right before action?
how do they choose which path to take?
11x11

Steps:
------
1) implement D*
2) find out how to use it
